/**
Aedi, a dependency injection library.

Aedi is a dependency injection library. It does provide a set of containers that do
IoC, and an interface to configure application components (structs, objects, etc.)

Aim:

The aim of library is to provide a dependency injection solution that is
feature rich, easy to use, easy to learn, and easy to extend up to your needs.

D by default comes with garbage collector which is responsible for destruction and
deallocation of components that were used, and discarded by the application. Current implementation
of garbage collector can be inefficient for cases when many small objects are continously
created and destroyed by application. Therefore aedi framework allows users to select what
allocation strategy to use for managed components by using std.experimental.allocator library.

To change the allocator used for components in a container, it is possible to
pass new allocator implementation to $(D_INLINECODE configure) method as third argument
just like in example below:
-------------
with (container.configure("singleton", Mallocator.instance.allocatorObject)) {
    // ... registered components with Mallocator as allocator for them
}
-------------

The allocator passed in $(D_INLINECODE configure) will be used as default implementation.
As alternative syntax it is possible to pass the allocator in a fluent syntax by chaining
$(D_INLINECODE along) to $(D_INLINECODE configure) with allocator as it's argument. Example
below shows such variant:
-------------
with (container.configure("prototype").along(MmapAllocator.instance.allocatorObject)) {
    // ... registered components with Mallocator as allocator for them
}
-------------

The default allocator strategy can be overriden per component by directly specifying the
allocator that should be used by registered component using $(D_INLINECODE allocator) property
for registered component. Example below shows such use case:
-------------
register!Size("size.sedan") // Register a size of a generic "sedan" into container
    .set!"width"(200UL)
    .set!"height"(150UL)
    .set!"length"(500UL)
    .allocator(MmapAllocator.instance.allocatorObject); // Change allocator object for this particular component to mmap allocator.
-------------

As a consequence to using custom allocation strategies, for all containers, $(D_INLINECODE terminate)
method should be called when containers lifetime ends (whether at end of application, or during some other
event), otherwise it is not guaranteed that components are finalized correctly, even if they were allocated on
garbage collector.
