/**
Aedi, a dependency injection library.

Aedi is a dependency injection library. It does provide a set of containers that do
IoC, and an interface to configure application components (structs, objects, etc.) 

Aim:

The aim of library is to provide a dependency injection solution that is
feature rich, easy to use, easy to learn, and easy to extend up to your needs.

Usage:

This tutorial will explain how to store values, into container, and how
they can be used.

During construction, of components managed by a container, some of them could
require things like user password, or uri of some resource. There is no point in "constructing
and configuring" such data as rest of the components that are more complex.
Therefore Aedi allows such data to be used during construction, by use of a 
container that holds it. The container it's not usable alone. Instead,
it is better to attach it to a composite container, to make data from container
available to rest of components:

--------------------
AggregateLocatorImpl!() container = new AggregateLocatorImpl!(); // An aggregate container that will fetch components from it's containers.
    SingletonContainer singleton = new SingletonContainer; 
    PrototypeContainer prototype = new PrototypeContainer;
    ObjectStorage!() values = new ObjectStorage!();
    
    
    container.set(singleton, "singleton"); // Let's add singleton container as a source for aggregate container
    container.set(prototype, "prototype"); // Let's add prototype container as a source for aggregate container
    container.set(values, "parameters");
--------------------

To register already available data in container use .register method:
--------------------
    container.register(Color(0, 255, 0), "color.green");
    container.register("divine tire", "tire.vendor");
--------------------

As with multiple containers example, by not specifying the identity of container
responsible for storing available data, .register method will search for
container identified by "parameters" and store the data in it.

Note, .register method can be used directly on value container:
--------------------
    values.register(Size(200, 150, 300), "size.smarty");
--------------------

Try running example. Add, modify it to understand usage of containers for already 
available values.
