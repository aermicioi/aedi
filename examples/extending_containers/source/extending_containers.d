/**
Aedi, a dependency injection library.

Aedi is a dependency injection library. It does provide a set of containers that do
IoC, and an interface to configure application components (structs, objects, etc.)

Aim:

The aim of library is to provide a dependency injection solution that is
feature rich, easy to use, easy to learn, and easy to extend up to your needs.

Extending factories tutorial explained that library can be extended in two ways,
factory direction and container direction. In AEDI framework containers have at least
two responsibilities. The first one is to serve components, and the second one is to
manage life time of served components.

Due to the first responsibility, AEDI has two basic containers, singleton and prototype. The
behavior of those two containers can be refound in other implementations of DIF like Spring frame-
work. Singleton container will serve same component no matter how many times a caller asks
it for a component associated with desired identity. Prototype container will serve new instance of
component each time it is asked by caller. Switchable decorating container presented decorated containers tutorial
limits in some sense the lifetime of it’s components only to the period when it is enabled.

A custom container should be implemented, only when existing ones are not providing features
required by the third party code (code that uses the framework). As stated, the purpose of a container
is to serve and manage components, and therefore a new implementation of a container should be
concerned with those tasks.

Compared to implementing a factory component, implementing a new container, requires it
to implement several interfaces. Each interface provides some functionality that can be used by
framework to enable some additional features related to container functionality. Implementation of
those interfaces is not imposed. The only requirement is to implement the basic Container interface
that exposes component serving abilities, along with option to instantiate them before their actual
usage. The following interfaces are allowed to be implemented by custom container:

$(UL
    $(LI $(D_INLINECODE Container) – exposes serving component features.)
    $(LI $(D_INLINECODE Storage) – exposes component factory storing capabilities.)
    $(LI $(D_INLINECODE FactoryLocator) – exposes component factory locating capabilities)
    $(LI $(D_INLINECODE AliasAware) – exposes aliasing of component’s identity to another identity)
    $(LI $(D_INLINECODE ConfigurableContainer) – exposes component factory storing capabilities along FactoryLocator and AliasAware)
)

Container:

Container interface is the minimal requirement for a custom container to implement, since it
offers component serving capabilities. Listing below presents the interface that is to be implemented
by custom containers. It is meaningful to implement only this interface when, container will not
integrate with any advanced features that framework provides.

------------------
interface Container : Locator!(Object, string) {

    public {

        Container instantiate();

        Container terminate();
    }
}
------------------

Storage:

By implementing Storage interface, a container declares it’s ability to store component
factories in it. Listing below displays abilities required to be implemented by container. Once a
container implements the interface, the component registration system can use the container to store
factories in it. In other words it is possible to use $(D_INLINECODE register) method on custom container. The
interface does not enforce, how stored components are used internally by container. They can never
be used, or used for other purposes, rather than serving created components to caller. Though,
by convention it is assumed that stored factory components are used for right purpose of creating
components served by container, and deviating from this convention, will lead in ambiguity in code
api that must be documented exhaustive.

------------------
interface Storage(Type, KeyType) {

    public {

        Storage set(Type element, KeyType identity);

        Storage remove(KeyType identity);
    }
}
------------------

FactoryLocator:

FactoryLocator interface, implemented by a container, exposes ability for exterior code to
access stored factory components in a container. Listing below shows the abilities that a container must implement.

Such functionality is useful for postprocessing of component factories after they are registered
into container, for various purposes. One of them, is dynamically register tagged components as a
dependency to an event emmiter component. The FactoryLocator functionality allows for third party
library developers, to implement more complicated and useful features based on postprocessing of
factory components.

------------------
interface FactoryLocator(T : Factory!Z, Z) {
    import std.range.interfaces;
    import std.typecons;

    public {

        T getFactory(string identity);

        InputRange!(Tuple!(T, string)) getFactories();
    }
}
------------------

AliasAware:

AliasAware implemented by a containers, exposes an interface to exterior by which aliasing
of identities becomes possible. Listing below shows the methods that a container should implement.
The aliasing of component identities can become handy, when a library provides a container with
components, and another third party code is reliant on a component from this container, yet the
dependency is referenced with another identity. Aliasing will allow the referenced identity to be
aliased to right identity of component. Such cases can occur when a component from a library is
deprecated and removed, and it’s functionality is provided by another one identified differently. In
the end the aliasing mechanism allows a component from container to be associated with multiple
identities.

------------------
interface AliasAware(Type) {

    public {

        AliasAware link(Type identity, Type alias_);

        AliasAware unlink(Type alias_);

        const(Type) resolve(in Type alias_) const;
    }
}
------------------

ConfigurableContainer:

ConfigurableContainer interface is amalgation of previosly defined interfaces. Instead of
declaring entire list of interfaces a container should implement, it is easier to replace it with ConfigurableCo
interface. Listing below shows the abilities that a container must implement

------------------
interface ConfigurableContainer : Container, Storage!(ObjectFactory, string), AliasAware!(string), FactoryLocator!ObjectFactory {

}
------------------

Try to run example. Modify it, run it again to understand how to implement
your own container.
