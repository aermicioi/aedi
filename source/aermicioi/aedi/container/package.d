/**
Defines interface for objects that are able to instantiate and manage lifetime for
instantiated objects. Provides a singleton, and prototype implementation of defined
interface.

The main task of an container container, is to manage the lifetime of 
objects contained in them. Therefore they can manage when an object registered
is created, how much it lives, and when it dies. This package provides containers 
for managed objects (singleton, and prototype for now). Singleton container
instantiates all registered objects at once, and keeps them alive until it itself
is destroyed/collected by garbage collector. Prototype on other hand, just creates
them and leave management of created objects to the rest of application.

    $(LI container.d -> contains the interfaces for containers. )
