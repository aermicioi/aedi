/**
Given a locator, locates an object and attempts to convert to T type.

Given a locator, locates an object and attempts to convert to T type.
When an object of T type is located, it is simply casted to T type.
When an value of T type is located, the func attempts to cast the requested object to
Wrapper!T, and will return it, instead of T directly.
In case of failure an InvalidCastException is thrown in debug environment.

Params:
	locator = the locator that contains the data with id as identity
	id = identity of object contained in locator

Throws:
	InvalidCastException in debug mode when actual type of object is not of type that is requested.

Returns:
	Object casted to desired type.
