Wrapper over some data of type T.

Wraps up a value of type T, and aliases itself to it. This object is used 
wrap any data that is not of reference type (class or interface),
in order to be saveable into an object storage.
Also thanks to alias value this semantics, in D is possible to do automatic
unboxing of values, just like Java does with simple values :P.
